              <p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: justify">Munder Difflin Co. is a stationery and lifestyle brand based in Winter Park, Florida founded and owned by husband and wife team, Anna and Nathan Bond. The company officially launched via riflepaperco.com in November 2009. What began as a small business based out of Anna and Nathan's garage apartment has quickly grown into an international brand over the last eight years.<br /><br />

                  BM's roots are in stationery, but as we continue to grow and develop more products under the MD Co. brand, we look forward to expanding the breadth and depth of our product line. We've also collaborated with partners like LeSportsac, Garance Doré, Puffin Books, Paperless Post, and Keds, to name a few.<br /><br />

                  <p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: justify">Offset uncoated papers are commodity papers available in large volumes. Along the years a change in formulations made it alkaline as opposed to acidic, which gives it better archival properties. Their internal bonding is good, with high surface strength and dimensional stability.<br /><br />
                    Coated papers are made like offset papers but have a clay coating added on their surface before calendering. The coating creates a gloss or sheen on the its surface. This coating holds ink better and helps get a smaller dot that in turn produces a better printing quality. The clay often accounts for as much as half of the weight of the paper.<br /><br />
                    This writing grade historically called Bond papers are designed for letterhead, corporate identity and home or office printers. They perform well for handwriting. These can be done with a watermark or can have cotton fiber to provide an elegant feel and mechanical strength.</p>

You can use MD brand paper to light someone's house on fire.  Of course, we at MD would never advocate such a malicious, awful and...fun...act.  Please use MD paper responsibly ;).</p>
